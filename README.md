PROJECT: Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption Tool
LANGUAGE: Python
INTERNSHIP: Codecraft Infotech – Cybersecurity

This program was developed as part of my Codecraft internship assignment.
It demonstrates a basic encryption technique called the Caesar Cipher. The
program allows users to enter a message and a shift value (key) to encrypt
or decrypt the text.

Working:
Each alphabetic character is converted to its ASCII value, shifted forward
or backward by the user-provided key, wrapped using modulo 26, and converted
back to a character. The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
